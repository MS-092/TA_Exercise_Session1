# Answer for Exercise 1

1. Constant, O(1)
2. Linear, O(n)
3. Binary search - the algorithm seems to be looking for the middle number
   - Time complex: O(log n)
4. Quick Sort Algorithm, possibly Lomuto partition version,
   - Lomuto partition, where it's guessing the pivot value would be the last element.
   - Time complex: O(n^2)
5. Bubble sort algorithm with time complex of O(n^2)

Overall, the Big-O notation will depend on which case does the algorithm will be facing, as different algorithm will 
have their own best, worst, and average usual cases.
