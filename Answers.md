1. Linear O(n)
2. O(n)
3. Binary search - looking for the middle number, O(log n)
4. Quick Sort Algorithm (possibly the improved version with random pivoting technique),
- Random pivot is where the pivot is chosen randomly, rather than the usual choosing from first, last, and middle 
  element of an array
- O(n^2)
5. Bubble sort algorithm, O(n^2)

Overall, the Big-O notation will depend on which case does the algorithm will be facing, as different algorithm will 
have their own best, worst, and average usual cases.
