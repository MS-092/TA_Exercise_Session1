# Answer for Exercise 1

1. Linear O(n)
2. O(n)
3. Binary search - looking for the middle number, O(log n)
4. Quick Sort Algorithm (possibly Lomuto partition scheme version),
   - Version, where it's guessing the pivot value would be the last element.
   - O(n^2)
5. Bubble sort algorithm, O(n^2)

Overall, the Big-O notation will depend on which case does the algorithm will be facing, as different algorithm will 
have their own best, worst, and average usual cases.
